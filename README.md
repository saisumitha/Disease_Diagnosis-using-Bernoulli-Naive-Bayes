Fill in the patient's name and select at least 3 symptoms from the dropdown menus.

Click on the "DISEASE PREDICTION" button to obtain the predicted disease based on the provided symptoms.

## Notes
Ensure the CSV files (Training.csv and Testing.csv) are formatted correctly with columns representing symptoms and corresponding diseases.
